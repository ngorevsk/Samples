Steps to run project:

1) Open Solution in Visual Studio 2017.
2) Perform NuGet package restore on solution to satisfy dependencies.
3) Set WpfTodoList project as startup project.

Interface selection:

ITodo
ITodoManager

Domain selection:

MainView - View that shows overview & details of selected item, also allows adding/deleting Todo items.
AddView - View that allows user to input dat to new Todo item that will be added.
Todo - Model of Todo item that includes all properties mentioned in requirements.
TodoManager - Model representing collection of Todo items that can be manipulated.


Other design considerations:

Prism - Framework for purpose for designing loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable application.


Unit Tests:

Unit tests are locted in the UnitTest project.
It contains tests against the basic requirements mentioned in the posting.


Other notes:

Setting up TreeView xaml and bindings took the most time along with creating the tests for
the unit testing project, as I am not very familiar with either.

Requirements:

TODO List

As a user, I can add a TODO to the list.
As a user, I can add one or more sub-TODOs to a top-level TODO. The application should only allow for a depth of 2 (parent/child relationship, no grandchildren). i.e., A child TODO should not be allowed to have children of its own.
If a sub-TODO exist and are all closed, then the parent TODO should close.
If a parent TODO closes, then all sub-TODOs should close.
As a user, I can see all the TODOs on the list in an overview.
As a user, I can drill into a TODO to see more information about the TODO.
As a user, I can delete a TODO.
As a user, I can mark a TODO as completed.
As a user, when I see all the TODOs in the overview, if today's date is past the TODO's deadline, highlight it.
A TODO consists of a task (just a simple sentence or two is fine), a deadline date, a completed flag, and an optional "more details" field that allows for more details to be given (again, a single large text area is fine for this).
The list of TODOs can be kept in memory.
